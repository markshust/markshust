# Hi there 👋

My name is Mark, and I've been a web developer for over 20 years. I create courses & screencasts for [M.academy](https://m.academy), and love creating technical educational content for [Magento](https://github.com/magento), [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel), [Docker](https://github.com/docker), [PHP](https://github.com/topics/php), & [JavaScript](https://github.com/topics/javascript).

## 🐳 + 🧡 + = 😍

My most popular repo is [docker-magento](https://github.com/markshust/docker-magento), a development environment I created for [Magento](https://github.com/magento) that is based on [Docker](https://github.com/docker). I've been working on it for over 5 years now, and it's by far my biggest accomplishment in open source.
