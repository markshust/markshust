# Hi there 👋

My name is Mark, and I've been a web developer for over 25 years. I create courses & screencasts for [M.academy](https://M.academy), which is the simplest way to learn Magento.

## 🐳 + 🧡 + = 😍

My most popular repo is [docker-magento](https://github.com/markshust/docker-magento), a development environment I created for [Magento](https://github.com/magento) that is based on [Docker](https://github.com/docker). I've been working on it for over 10 years now, and it's by far my biggest accomplishment in open source.

## Fun facts

- I'm married to my wonderful wife Juliann and we have twin girls 👯‍♂️
- I have a [red Nissan 240sx convertible](https://www.instagram.com/markshust240sx/) that I love to modify 🏎
- Once, I got lucky & bowled a 300 game 🎳
- In my spare time, I like puzzles, mind games, ...and programming some more 👨‍💻
- Chipotle burritos are my fav 🌯💖 If you like my OSS work, please consider [buying me a burrito](https://github.com/sponsors/markshust/)
